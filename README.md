# openDTU Breakout Booard

To read Hoymiles inverters there is a nice project called [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) which uses an ESP32 to talk to them. 

<br>

To extend this project with a hardware component this small KiCAD board was created. With it it should be possible for the not experienced in soldering person to build an own OpenDTU easier. But also the possibility to add further ideas, like temperature sensors, display etc.. In a second step it is also possible to design a board with all the necessary components on it directly.
